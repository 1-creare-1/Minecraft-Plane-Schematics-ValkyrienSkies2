# How to use

1) Go to the create config, and set `Link Range` to the max

2) Add a stabilizer to the back, as the schematic doesnt inculde one
3) Glue all the controll surfaces
4) Connect the prop to the plane with a Takeoff rotor (they connect to rotor heads if there is one nearby, this can be quite finicky though)
5) Configure a linked controller like so:
